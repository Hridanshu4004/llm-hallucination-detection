Answer whether the claim is true or false and explain briefly.
True. Epistemology attempts to understand the justification for social inequalities by examining the theory of justification, which is a part of epistemology that focuses on understanding the justification of propositions and beliefs. In the context of social inequality, the theory of justification seeks to identify the reasons why certain groups or individuals are more likely to hold and perpetuate social inequalities than others. By exploring the justifications underlying these beliefs, we can gain insights into the ways in which social institutions, practices, and norms contribute to and reinforce these inequalities.
